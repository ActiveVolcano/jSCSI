<h1>ViSCSI Usage Instructions</h1>
<p>ViSCSI is a Eclipse plugin and visualizing tool for jSCSI, which supports the analysis of block layout and access patterns.
You only have to install ViSCSI in Eclipse and have access to an jSCSI server via network for using ViSCSI.</p>
<p>Once you have started Eclipse with ViSCSI, open the window &quot;Show View&quot; (Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Other...),
select ViSCSI/ViSCSI Control Center and press OK. Enter the network path to your jSCSI server and click on the &quot;Apply&quot;
button. Click on &quot;New Histogram&quot; or &quot;New Pattern&quot; depending on what you want to see. In the new
visible Views select the device you want to display and the options as needed. If you want to have the legend as
well, go to the Show View window and select ViSCSI/ViSCSI Legend.</p>
<p>If there are some block-type informations as well, insert the path to the type log-file and press the &quot;Apply
&quot; button. Sometimes there are only rare hits on all blocks, to make them more visible, use the Scales in the &quot;
ViSCSI Control Center&quot;.</p>
