/**
 * <h1>LoginStatus</h1>
 * <p>
 * This enumeration contains only all defined Login Stati, which can send in a
 * login response message in the iSCSI Protocol (RFC3720).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr>
 * <td>0</td>
 * <td>Success - indicates that the iSCSI target successfully received,
 * understood, and accepted the request. The numbering fields (
 * <code>StatSN</code>, <code>ExpCmdSN</code>, <code>MaxCmdSN</code>)
 * are only valid if Status-Class is <code>0</code>.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>1</td>
 * <td> Redirection - indicates that the initiator must take further action to
 * complete the request. This is usually due to the target moving to a different
 * address. All of the redirection status class responses MUST return one or
 * more text key parameters of the type &quot;TargetAddress&quot;, which
 * indicates the target's new address. A redirection response MAY be issued by a
 * target prior or after completing a security negotiation if a security
 * negotiation is required. A redirection SHOULD be accepted by an initiator
 * even without having the target complete a security negotiation if any
 * security negotiation is required, and MUST be accepted by the initiator after
 * the completion of the security negotiation if any security negotiation is
 * required.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td>Initiator Error (not a format error) - indicates that the initiator most
 * likely caused the error. This MAY be due to a request for a resource for
 * which the initiator does not have permission. The request should not be tried
 * again.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td>Target Error - indicates that the target sees no errors in the
 * initiatorâ€™s Login Request, but is currently incapable of fulfilling the
 * request. The initiator may re-try the same Login Request later. The table
 * below shows all of the currently allocated status codes. The codes are in
 * hexadecimal; the first byte is the status class and the second byte is the
 * status detail.</td>
 * </tr>
